About Me!
======
I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am pursuing a master's degree in data science. Currently, I am a research assistant at Penn's [Computational Social Listening Lab](https://csl-lab-upenn.github.io/), under Dr. Sharath Chandra Guntuku. There, I am working with postdoc Dr. Vivienne Bihe Chi on a project leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze multimodal primary care visit data and examine provider-patient trust. 

I have an additional 4.5 years of combined research experience working at various psychology labs throughout my undergraduate career at Brown University and, most recently, at UCSF's Eating Disorders Program as their clinical research coordinator. I am very interested in the application of statistical methods, innovative technologies, and data science in the study of mental health and human well-being, and I am especially passionate about researching and improving healthcare access and quality in marginalized and understudied populations!
