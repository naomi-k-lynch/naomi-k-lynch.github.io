Mini Photo Gallery
------

Photos I've deemed important enough to share online. Guest appearances made by my wonderful cat, Mara, a recent meal I really loved, and a little thing that's made me happy. And yes, this does get updated periodically.

<style>
.photo-gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 15px;
  margin: 20px 0;
}

.photo-gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 250px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.photo-gallery img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
</style>
<script>
function openLightbox(src) {
  const lightbox = document.createElement('div');
  lightbox.style.cssText = 'position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.9);display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;z-index:9999;cursor:pointer;';
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = src;
  img.style.cssText = 'max-width:90%;max-height:90%;border-radius:8px;';
  lightbox.appendChild(img);
  lightbox.onclick = () => document.body.removeChild(lightbox);
  document.body.appendChild(lightbox);
}

A List of Philly Restaurants I Love + Recommend
------

This is in no particular order. For the sake of those interested, I want to keep this list diverse:

1. Kalaya - Southern Thai in Fishtown; my go-to for any celebration; I first went in 2021 (before all the hype) at their old location and yes it's that good.
2. Ambrosia - Italian in Fitler Square; cozy and warm, non-intimidating and intimate; incredible gnocchi (I think about it often); grab yourself an espresso martini.
3. Khyber Pass - Pub in Old City; very relaxed with a fun beer selection that rotates; surprisingly good vegetarian/vegan options; awesome po boys of the month(!!!).
4. Circles - Takeout Thai in Northern Liberties; what I'll probably order for Monday night football, homey and delicious; do NOT confuse this for their other location.
5. The Dandelion - British Pub in Rittenhouse; live out your English fantasy; fish and chips and fun apps; I quite like it for brunch.
6. Butcher & Singer - Steakhouse in Rittenhouse-ish; wonderful Hollywood atmosphere; banging raw bar, appetizers (shoutout broccolini), dessert, and of course, steak.
7. Suraya - Lebanese in Fishtown; incredible pita and mezze; pastries are the best I've had in a long time; beautifully designed space; you're welcome.
8. Hikari - Sushi in Northern Liberties; casual and lowkey, always dependable; good-quality fish and fun specialty rolls; if you can, get a crispy rice.
9. China House - Takeout Chinese in Northern Liberties; my old reliable; if you need something greasy and yummy look no further; all the classics.
10. Chubby Cattle - Hot Pot in Chinatown; it's unlimited hotpot, no further explanation needed; walk off your food with a stroll around Chinatown.

For more, please contact me directly. This is the stuff I live for.
